One of the worst offenders in recent times seems to be the financial media, which seems to rarely draw distinctions between the core ideas behind these terms.</p><p>However, I think that this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-wall-street-robots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> in Bloomberg from October of last year does a good job of covering the potential impact of technology in finance, distinguishing between the buy/sell-side and further breaking things down sector-by-sector. Here is an overview which I think summarizes the main themes in the article well:</p><pre><i>Sell side credit markets</i>: Natural-language processing, data collection and machine learning are being applied to automate subjective human decisions.<br><br><i>Sell side foreign exchange</i>: Big data and machine learning are being used to anticipate variations in client demand and the resulting price swings.<br><br><i>Sell side commodities</i>: Trader and salesperson conversations are being catalogued to create profiles of clients.<br><br><i>Sell side equities</i>: Artificial intelligence is being applied to order execution.<br><br><i>Buy side equities</i>: Predictive analytics is being applied to time stock purchases and assess risk based on market liquidity.<br><br><i>Buy side credit</i>: Computer programs are being trained to scan and understand bond covenants, legal documents and court rulings.<br><br><i>Buy side macroeconomics</i>: Natural-language processing is being used to analyze central bank commentary for clues on monetary policy. Other software is analyzing data such as oil-tanker shipments and satellite images (e.g., Chinese industrial sites, Walmart parking lots and more) to spot trends in the economy.</pre></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__footer__col"></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://thedeep3nd.io/fun-with-dns/" class="inverse" rel="prev">fun with DNS</a></h5></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://thedeep3nd.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f503b0ac46db9f99180b3b9f932c7f9a"></script></body></html>
