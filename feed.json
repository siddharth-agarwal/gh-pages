Happened to come across their Github repo the other day and decided to give it a shot.</p>\n<p>With regard to the current setup, I'm using a Github Pages backend (link to the <a href=\"https://github.com/siddharth-agarwal/gh-pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github repo</a>) redirected to a custom domain name (<em>thedeep3nd.io</em>) - Publii handles most/all of the boilerplate JS/CSS/HTML code to link the two. I looked into some other options - namely, Jekyll and Octopress - when deciding on a framework for this site, but Publii had a couple things that really appealed to me and eventually won me over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>great desktop client for Mac</li>\n<li><strong>accessible/concise documentation</strong></li>\n<li>ability to build/preview local changes before deploying (committing) to the Github repo</li>\n<li>an active and growing open-source community</li>\n<li>free to use!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm sure that it's not the most feature-rich or customizable CMS tool out there, but it seems to have pretty much everything that I want: simplicity, ease of use, and (hopefully) dependability.  </p>\n<hr><address>More to come.</address>",
